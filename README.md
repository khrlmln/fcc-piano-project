# Piano Project

#### This project is created to complete [freecodecamp's piano project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-responsive-web-design-by-building-a-piano/)

#### In this project, I used CSS and Responsive Design to code a piano. also used a bit of media queries and pseudo selectors.
